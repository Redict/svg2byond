# svg2byond: ByondAPI library for SVG to PNG conversion.

Depends on [lunasvg](https://github.com/sammycage/lunasvg).

More of a proof-of-concept than a working product. Clunky as hell. Tested only on Windows.

What possibly could be done more with enough effort:
 - Return image data using byondapi instead of saving into a local folder.
 - Find a way to render the image using nearest neigbor scaling (or somehow avoid blurry edges).
